Summary:

This is an osc plugin that allows the user to do OBS project level
builds. It calculates the correct build order by using buildinfos from
the OBS server.

It supports building packages from several different projects, if the
packages are checked out in the same directory, assuming all the projects
contain the target repository.


Usage:

The simple use case is to osc checkout an OBS project, move to that directory
and run 'osc prjmake REPOSITORY', this will build all the packages in the
checked out project.

Another way to use prjmake is to define a set of 'changed' packages with
'osc prjmake REPOSITORY PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2 ...'. In this case, only the
necessary rebuilds are done for other packages.


Restrictions:

It is possible to get wrong build orders if multiple Provides and Requires
for different packages are changed locally, as the dependency resolution
relies on the server for solving requirements where the requirement does not
match a package name.


Note:

osc prjmake cannot handle circular dependencies the same way OBS server can, so
it will just fail if it detects one.

Packages should also be buildable without having to specify what specfile to
use, since the plugin does not support specifying the specfiles from project
level.
